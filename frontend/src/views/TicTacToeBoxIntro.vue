        Each player has two small, medium and large size boxes.
        The player places or moves one box onto the 3 by 3 board, per turn.
        To move or place boxes (by clicking the box and board), you should follow the following rules:
        <ol>
          <li>Boxes placed or moved on the board can cover a box which is smaller than it or be placed on a blank area.</li>
          <li>The box a player wants to move has to be the top box; you cannot move a box covered by a larger box.</li>
          <li>If a box on the board is moved, any box it covered will appear.</li>
        </ol>A player will win the game if three of their boxes, of any size, are in a line, row or diagonal.
